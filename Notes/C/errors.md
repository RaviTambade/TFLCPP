 #  Different Types of Errors
 
 In programming, errors can occur at different stages of the development process, and understanding these stages can help you troubleshoot problems effectively. Here's a breakdown of the three types you mentioned:

1. **Compile-Time Errors**:
   - **When They Occur**: During the compilation phase, which is when the source code is translated into machine code (or intermediate code) by a compiler.
   - **What They Are**: These errors are detected by the compiler and usually involve issues with the syntax or structure of the code. Examples include missing semicolons, incorrect variable names, type mismatches, or other violations of the language's rules.
   - **Examples**: 
     - Missing a semicolon at the end of a statement in languages like C++ or Java.
     - Trying to use a variable that hasn’t been declared.

2. **Linking Errors**:
   - **When They Occur**: During the linking phase, which is when various pieces of compiled code are combined into a single executable file.
   - **What They Are**: These errors occur when the linker cannot resolve references to symbols or functions. This typically happens if the implementation of a function is missing, or there are mismatches between function declarations and their definitions.
   - **Examples**:
     - Calling a function that’s declared but not defined.
     - Missing library files that the code depends on.

3. **Runtime Errors**:
   - **When They Occur**: During the execution of the program, after it has been successfully compiled and linked.
   - **What They Are**: These errors occur while the program is running and can be due to various issues that weren't caught during compilation or linking. They often result in abnormal termination or incorrect behavior.
   - **Examples**:
     - Dividing by zero.
     - Accessing invalid memory or null pointers.
     - File operations failing due to missing files or incorrect permissions.

To summarize:
- **Compile-Time Errors** are detected by the compiler due to syntax or structural issues in the code.
- **Linking Errors** happen when the linker cannot resolve references between compiled code units.
- **Runtime Errors** occur during program execution and often involve logical errors or unexpected conditions.

Each type of error requires different strategies to resolve, so understanding where and why they occur can help you fix them more efficiently.
