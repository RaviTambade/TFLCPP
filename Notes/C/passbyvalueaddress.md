Let’s break this down using **mechanical engineering analogies** and a focus on **stack memory usage**:

---

### 1. **Pass by Value vs. Pass by Address: The Workshop Analogy**
Imagine you’re working in a machine shop, and you need to modify a **large metal part** (data).  

#### **Pass by Value**:  
- You **create an exact copy** of the part and hand the copy to a colleague.  
- Your colleague modifies the copy (drills holes, cuts edges), but **the original part remains untouched**.  
- **Problem**: Copying a massive part takes up extra space on the workbench (stack memory). If you do this repeatedly, the bench overflows.  

#### **Pass by Address**:  
- Instead of copying, you hand your colleague a **map** (memory address) to the original part’s location.  
- Your colleague modifies the **original part directly** using the map.  
- **Advantage**: No extra copies clutter the workbench (stack). Only the small map is passed.  

---

### 2. **Code Example (C++)**  
Let’s see this in code:

#### **Pass by Value**:
```cpp
void modifyCopy(int x) { 
  x = 100; // Modifies the COPY (original stays 5)
}

int main() {
  int original = 5;
  modifyCopy(original); // Creates a COPY of 'original'
  // original = 5 (unchanged)
}
```

#### **Pass by Address**:
```cpp
void modifyOriginal(int* x) { 
  *x = 100; // Modifies the ORIGINAL via its address
}

int main() {
  int original = 5;
  modifyOriginal(&original); // Passes the ADDRESS of 'original'
  // original = 100 (changed)
}
```

---

### 3. **Stack Memory Overhead: Why Pass by Value Can Be Wasteful**
Think of the **stack** as a **limited-size workbench**. Every time you call a function, tools (data) are placed on the bench.  

- **Small data** (e.g., `int x`):  
  Copying is cheap (like handing a wrench). No big deal.  

- **Large data** (e.g., a 3D model with 10,000 points):  
  Pass by value **copies the entire model** onto the bench. Do this a few times, and the bench overflows (stack overflow).  

#### Example with a Large Object:
```cpp
struct BigData {
  double points[10000]; // Huge struct!
};

void processData(BigData copy) { ... } // Copy eats up stack space

int main() {
  BigData data;
  processData(data); // STACK OVERFLOW RISK!
}
```

#### Fix with Pass by Address:
```cpp
void processData(BigData* ptr) { ... } // Only a tiny address is passed

int main() {
  BigData data;
  processData(&data); // Safe for the stack!
}
```

### 4. **Real-World Consequences**  
- **Pass by Value**: Safe (no unintended changes) but **inefficient for large data**. Use for small, simple objects.  
- **Pass by Address**: Efficient (no copying) but risky (original can be altered). Use for large/complex data.  

---

### 5. **Visualizing the Stack**  
Imagine stacking plates (function calls):  
- Each plate (function) holds copies of data.  
- Pass by value = stacking **full-sized plates**.  
- Pass by address = stacking **tiny plates with labels**.  

Too many full-sized plates? The stack collapses 💥.  

---

### Summary for a Mechanical Engineer:  
- **Pass by Value** = Copying a part; safe but wastes bench space.  
- **Pass by Address** = Sharing a map; efficient but handle with care.  
- **Stack Overflow** = Workbench collapsing from too many copies.  

Here's a **text-based diagram** to visualize how **pass by value** vs. **pass by address** affects the stack. (Since I can't draw images, I’ll use symbols to simulate it!)  

---

### **1. Pass by Value: Stack Overflow Risk**
Imagine a function `processPart()` that takes a **copy** of a large object. Each call stacks a copy:  

```
Original Data (Workshop Shelf):
[██████████]  // Large part (e.g., 10KB)

Stack (Workbench) during `processPart()`:
[██████████]  // Copy 1 (10KB)
[██████████]  // Copy 2 (10KB)
[██████████]  // Copy 3 (10KB)
...  
💥 Stack overflow! Workbench collapses.
```

**Key Takeaway**:  
- Copies pile up on the stack (limited space).  
- Large objects = faster overflow.  

---

### **2. Pass by Address: Efficient Stack Use**
The same function now takes an **address** (pointer/reference). Only a tiny address is stacked:  

```
Original Data (Workshop Shelf):
[██████████]  // Large part (10KB)

Stack (Workbench) during `processPart()`:
[📍]  // Address to shelf (e.g., 4 bytes)
[📍]  // Another address (4 bytes)
[📍]  // ...  
✅ Workbench stays clean!
```

**Key Takeaway**:  
- Addresses are tiny (e.g., 4-8 bytes).  
- Stack stays lightweight, even with many calls.

### **3. Combined Visualization**  
```
PASS BY VALUE (Copies)       PASS BY ADDRESS (Pointers)
──────────────────────────   ──────────────────────────
Stack:                       Stack:  
[██████████]                 [📍]  
[██████████]                 [📍]  
[██████████]                 [📍]  
(Overflow risk!)             (Efficient!)  
```

---

### **Analogy Breakdown**  
- **Original Data**: Stored on the "shelf" (heap or main memory).  
- **Stack**: Your workbench (limited space).  
- **Address**: A tiny map (📍) pointing to the shelf.  
- **Copy**: A full-sized duplicate part (wastes bench space).  

---

### **Why This Matters**  
Mechanical systems (like hydraulic controls or CNC machines) often use software where **stack efficiency** is critical. For example:  
- Repetitive function calls with large sensor data → **pass by address** avoids crashes.  
- Small configuration values → **pass by value** is safe and simple.
