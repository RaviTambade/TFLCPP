Abstraction is a concept that involves simplifying complex systems or ideas by focusing on the essential details and ignoring irrelevant ones. It allows you to create a general representation of something, which can be used in different contexts without dealing with the specifics.

In different fields, abstraction takes on slightly different meanings:

- **In computer science and programming**, abstraction refers to hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary parts. For example, when you use a function or method in code, you don't need to understand how it works internally; you only need to know what it does and how to use it.

- **In mathematics**, abstraction allows you to generalize concepts and work with higher-level structures that aren't tied to specific instances, like using variables instead of specific numbers in equations.

- **In art or philosophy**, abstraction refers to representing concepts, emotions, or objects in a non-literal way, focusing on the essence rather than detailed representation.

In essence, abstraction helps make things more manageable and understandable by removing unnecessary complexity.

## Procedural Thinking
Procedural thinking is a way of approaching problem-solving or tasks by breaking them down into a series of steps or actions that need to be followed in a specific order to achieve a desired result. This method focuses on creating a sequence of operations or procedures to solve a problem, emphasizing **the "how"** (the process) rather than the final goal.

In procedural thinking:

- **Tasks are organized in a logical sequence**, where each step builds on the previous one.
- **Clear instructions or rules are followed**, which are often written as procedures, algorithms, or steps in a plan.
- **Each step is usually repeatable** and leads to the completion of a goal in a predictable manner.

### Examples of Procedural Thinking:

1. **In programming**: Writing code in a structured way where each function or method performs a specific task, and these functions are executed in a sequence to achieve the programâ€™s goals.
   
2. **In everyday life**: A recipe for cooking a dish where each step, from preparation to cooking, needs to be followed in order to achieve the final result.

3. **In problem-solving**: A step-by-step approach to solving a math problem, where you follow a series of defined steps (such as using formulas or operations) to get to the solution.

### Key Elements:
- **Sequencing**: The order in which tasks or steps are performed matters.
- **Decomposition**: Breaking down a complex task into smaller, more manageable steps.
- **Control**: Managing the flow of operations, ensuring that each step is completed before moving on to the next.

Procedural thinking is highly useful for tasks that are repetitive, well-defined, and require a structured approach to achieve consistency and reliability.
