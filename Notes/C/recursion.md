The difference between **iteration** and **recursion** lies primarily in how they approach solving problems. Both are ways to repeat actions or perform repetitive tasks, but they do so in very different manners.

### 1. **Definition:**
   - **Iteration** is a process where a set of instructions is executed repeatedly using loops (e.g., `for`, `while` loops) until a certain condition is met.
   - **Recursion** is a process where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the problem, typically breaking the problem down into simpler subproblems.

### 2. **Flow:**
   - **Iteration:** Repeats a block of code for a set number of times or until a condition is met.
     - Example: You repeat something using loops.
   - **Recursion:** A function calls itself, gradually reducing the problem size until it reaches the base case, which stops further recursive calls.

### 3. **How it works:**
   - **Iteration:** 
     - It uses a loop construct (like `for` or `while`), with a counter or condition that controls how long the loop runs.
     - Example: A `for` loop to sum numbers.
   - **Recursion:** 
     - A function calls itself with modified arguments until it hits a base case, which ends the recursive calls.
     - Example: A function calling itself to compute the factorial of a number.

### 4. **Memory Usage:**
   - **Iteration:** 
     - Iterative approaches usually use less memory, as they only need a few variables to track the loopâ€™s state (such as a counter).
   - **Recursion:** 
     - Recursive functions use more memory because each function call adds a new layer to the call stack, which can lead to stack overflow if the recursion is too deep.

### 5. **Performance:**
   - **Iteration:** 
     - Often more efficient in terms of memory and execution speed for problems that can be solved with simple loops.
   - **Recursion:** 
     - Can be less efficient due to overhead from function calls, but it can simplify solving problems that naturally fit into recursive patterns (like tree traversals, searching algorithms).

### 6. **Use Cases:**
   - **Iteration:** 
     - Suitable for problems that involve repeating a process a known number of times, like summing numbers, iterating over arrays, or processing items in a list.
   - **Recursion:** 
     - More suitable for problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems, like calculating factorials, solving mazes, or performing tree/graph traversals.

### 7. **Example Comparison:**
#### Iteration (Summing Numbers 1 to `n`):
```python
def sum_iterative(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        total += i
    return total
```

#### Recursion (Summing Numbers 1 to `n`):
```python
def sum_recursive(n):
    if n == 0:  # Base case
        return 0
    else:  # Recursive case
        return n + sum_recursive(n-1)
```

### 8. **Advantages and Disadvantages:**
   - **Iteration:**
     - **Advantages:** 
       - Typically faster and more memory-efficient for simple repetitive tasks.
     - **Disadvantages:**
       - Can be less elegant for problems that have a natural recursive structure.
   
   - **Recursion:**
     - **Advantages:** 
       - Can be more intuitive and easier to understand when solving problems that fit naturally with recursive thinking (e.g., divide-and-conquer algorithms).
     - **Disadvantages:**
       - Can be less efficient in terms of memory usage and execution speed for simple problems that can be solved with iteration.
       - Risk of stack overflow if the recursion depth is too large.

### Summary of Differences:

| **Aspect**           | **Iteration**                          | **Recursion**                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **How it works**      | Repeats a block of code with loops.    | A function calls itself with smaller inputs. |
| **Memory usage**      | Uses a fixed amount of memory.         | Uses more memory due to function calls. |
| **Performance**       | More efficient for simple repetitive tasks. | Less efficient due to function call overhead. |
| **When to use**       | When you know how many times you need to repeat an action. | When a problem naturally fits a divide-and-conquer approach. |
