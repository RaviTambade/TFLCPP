# Execution

To explain the roles of CPU, threads, scheduler, and executable code in a simple and sequential way, think of it like running a restaurant.

1. **Executable Code (Recipe)**:  
   This is the **set of instructions** that tells the computer what tasks to perform, like a **recipe** in a restaurant. It's the program you've written or downloaded and contains the steps to achieve a specific goal (e.g., calculating numbers, displaying text). This code is the starting point.

2. **Thread (Cook)**:  
   A **thread** is like a **cook** in the restaurant. It is a unit of work that performs one task at a time. A program can have multiple threads (cooks) that each perform different tasks (cooking different dishes). So, the code (recipe) can be divided into different threads, with each thread executing a part of the program.

3. **CPU (Kitchen)**:  
   The **CPU** is like the **kitchen** where all the work gets done. It performs the actual processing, executing the instructions from the code. The CPU takes the work (threads) and processes them, just like the kitchen takes ingredients and turns them into meals.

4. **Scheduler (Waiter)**:  
   The **scheduler** is like a **waiter** who organizes which cook (thread) should do the next task in the kitchen (CPU). If there are many tasks, the scheduler decides which thread gets CPU time and when. It ensures the work gets done efficiently and that the cooks (threads) don’t collide or work on the same task at the same time. The scheduler makes sure everything flows smoothly.

### Sequence:
1. **Executable Code** (recipe) is created and tells what needs to be done.
2. The **thread** (cook) takes the instructions and begins working on them.
3. The **CPU** (kitchen) executes the instructions, processing the tasks.
4. The **scheduler** (waiter) decides which task gets processed next, ensuring the smooth flow of work.

In essence, the **executable code** gives instructions, **threads** carry out those instructions, **CPU** does the actual processing, and the **scheduler** organizes the work.



It sounds like you're diving deep into concepts related to software execution, threading, and parallel programming. You mentioned polymorphism earlier, but now you’re shifting towards the execution model in software, focusing on concurrency, multitasking, and parallel programming, and the technicalities of how these concepts manifest in C++ and general programming.

Here's a breakdown of what you've been discussing and a bit more explanation:

1. **Polymorphism & Polymorphic Behavior**:
   - **Polymorphism** in object-oriented programming refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways. This is crucial for inheritance-based designs where multiple derived classes might implement the same method in different ways, providing unique behavior depending on the object type.

2. **Concurrency and Multitasking**:
   - **Concurrency** refers to the ability to manage multiple tasks at once, which might not necessarily run at the same exact time but are handled so that it appears like they're happening simultaneously. This can be achieved through techniques like context switching.
   - **Multitasking** refers to executing multiple tasks at the same time on a system. This can be either through true **parallel execution** or through switching between tasks so quickly that it feels like they're happening at the same time.

3. **Parallel Programming**:
   - In **parallel programming**, tasks are literally run at the same time, often on multiple processors or cores. This requires managing multiple threads or processes running simultaneously.
   - **Azure Multithreading** and **Asynchronous Programming**: These are techniques used to allow a program to perform multiple operations concurrently. For example, a thread may be listening for user input while another thread is processing data, without waiting for the first task to finish.

4. **Serial Execution vs. Parallel Execution**:
   - **Serial execution** involves tasks being processed one by one. For example, a single thread might perform multiple tasks (like listening, speaking, and watching) sequentially.
   - **Parallel execution** means multiple tasks are being carried out at the same time (e.g., listening, speaking, and watching happening simultaneously by different threads or processes).

5. **Threading**:
   - A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Each task, such as speaking or listening, can be handled by a different thread.
   - **Single-threaded execution** means that tasks are performed one after another, while **multi-threaded execution** allows tasks to be performed simultaneously in parallel, improving efficiency.

6. **Async and Await**:
   - **Async programming** is essential for handling operations that take time (e.g., waiting for data from a server) without blocking other operations. In modern C++ (C++11 and later), this is done through threading and task handling.
   - The concepts of **Promise**, **Future**, **Async**, and **Await** are typically associated with asynchronous programming. They allow a function to return a promise of a result that will be available in the future, and other operations can continue while waiting for the result.

7. **Compiler, Linker, and Execution Flow**:
   - When you write a C++ program, the **compiler** turns your source code into object code (often `.obj` or `.o` files), and the **linker** then combines these into an executable (`.exe`) file.
   - The **process** is created by the operating system when the program is run. Each process has its own memory space and includes threads of execution.

8. **Kernel and OS**:
   - The **operating system's kernel** manages resources and executes programs. It creates a **process** for each application, which runs in its own memory space.
   - The kernel, along with device drivers, handles low-level hardware interactions. This is what ensures that applications, like your C++ program, can run on the hardware.

9. **Memory Management**:
   - Within a process, **dynamic memory allocation** occurs in the heap, which allows programs to allocate and deallocate memory during execution. This is essential for managing resources efficiently, especially when dealing with large data sets or complex tasks.
   
I see that you're also referring to some previous discussions you had in your training, and it looks like you were touching upon some foundational ideas related to how operating systems and software handle execution and resource management.

Would you like to dive deeper into a specific concept, like multithreading in C++ or asynchronous programming, or discuss how polymorphism fits into a concurrent system?


The lecture you've shared provides an in-depth explanation of **single-threaded** and **multi-threaded** execution in programming, along with how operating systems manage these processes.

Here’s a summary of the key points:

### 1. **Single-threaded Execution**:
   - In single-threaded execution, a **single thread** (or task) is responsible for executing one instruction after another. 
   - For example, in a program with multiple functions like `main()`, `printHello()`, `acceptInput()`, and `displayOutput()`, these functions are called one at a time in sequence. The process goes step-by-step, waiting for one task to complete before moving to the next.
   - The **main thread** executes everything sequentially, meaning no two tasks are executed simultaneously.

### 2. **Threads and Execution**:
   - A **thread** is essentially a single unit of execution. The **primary thread** (or main thread) is the one that starts the execution of a program.
   - In a **single-threaded application**, only one thread does all the work sequentially. Hence, while the program can perform several tasks, only one task is completed at any point in time.

### 3. **Multiple Tasks in Single-threaded Execution**:
   - Even though you might have multiple functions in your code, **only one function is executed at a time** in a single-threaded program. The program has to wait for the current task to finish before it moves on to the next.
   - Example: If your program calls `main()`, which in turn calls `printHello()`, then `acceptInput()`, and so on, it will do so sequentially, one by one.

### 4. **Thread and Memory**:
   - **Heap memory** and **stack memory** are two key components of memory management in execution:
     - **Stack memory** holds local variables and function calls, and once these go out of scope, they are popped off the stack.
     - **Heap memory**, on the other hand, is used for dynamic memory allocation (using `malloc` in C or `new` in C++) and is used for objects that need to persist for a longer duration than a single function's scope.

### 5. **Parallel Execution**:
   - In a **multi-threaded application**, multiple threads can work on different tasks simultaneously, which is often required in multi-user or server applications. 
   - For example, in a shopping application where 20,000 users might be accessing the system at once, a **single-threaded** approach won't work efficiently because the tasks would have to be executed sequentially, which would be too slow.
   - **Parallel execution** allows multiple threads to run at the same time, making the application much more responsive and scalable. For this, each thread can execute a different task, like one handling user input, another processing data, etc.

### 6. **When is Parallel Execution Needed?**:
   - Parallel execution is needed when the program has to handle multiple tasks **simultaneously** (like in multi-user applications, or high-performance computing).
   - For example, in an online shopping application, different threads might be required to handle user requests for purchasing, cancelling, and tracking delivery **at the same time**.

### 7. **Multi-threaded Programming**:
   - In a **multi-threaded program**, each thread can handle an independent task. This allows for greater efficiency when handling concurrent tasks.
   - In **parallel programming**, threads work together to perform a job faster by dividing the work into multiple smaller tasks that can be performed at the same time.

### 8. **Entry Point and Main Function**:
   - The **main function** serves as the entry point for most programs. Without the main function, a program can’t execute because the operating system needs a starting point to begin execution.

### Summary of Execution Types:
- **Single-threaded Execution**: Only one thread (the main thread) executes tasks one after another.
- **Multi-threaded Execution**: Multiple threads can execute different tasks at the same time, allowing for parallelism and more efficient task management.

In essence, the difference between **serial** and **parallel** execution is the ability of parallel execution to handle multiple tasks concurrently, which is crucial for applications that need to serve multiple users or perform complex tasks quickly.

If you're learning these concepts, the key takeaway is that **multi-threading** is crucial for efficiency in environments where multiple tasks or users need to be served simultaneously, such as in servers or interactive applications.
