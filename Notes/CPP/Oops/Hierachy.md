## **hierarchy** 
In C++, **hierarchy** typically refers to the way different components of a program are structured or organized, especially in relation to **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles. A hierarchy in OOP represents relationships between classes, where classes can inherit from other classes, forming parent-child relationships. This is central to concepts like **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **encapsulation**, which are the building blocks of object-oriented design.

### Hierarchy in C++ OOP Context

In C++, a hierarchy is often structured using **classes** and **inheritance**. Here's how hierarchy generally works in C++:

### 1. **Class Hierarchy (Inheritance)**
   - **Inheritance** allows one class (the **child** or **derived class**) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (the **parent** or **base class**).
   - This structure creates a hierarchy of classes where more specialized classes can inherit from more general ones.
   - **Single Inheritance**: A class inherits from one base class.
   - **Multiple Inheritance**: A class inherits from multiple base classes (allowed in C++).
   - **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class inherits from a class that already inherits from another class.

   **Example of Class Hierarchy:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   
   // Base class (parent class)
   class Animal {
   public:
       void speak() {
           std::cout << "Animal makes a sound" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   // Derived class (child class)
   class Dog : public Animal {
   public:
       void speak() {
           std::cout << "Dog barks" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   // Another derived class (child class)
   class Cat : public Animal {
   public:
       void speak() {
           std::cout << "Cat meows" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Animal animal;
       animal.speak();  // Output: Animal makes a sound

       Dog dog;
       dog.speak();  // Output: Dog barks

       Cat cat;
       cat.speak();  // Output: Cat meows

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   In the example above:
   - `Animal` is the base class.
   - `Dog` and `Cat` are derived classes that inherit from `Animal`.
   - The `speak` method is overridden in the derived classes to provide specific behavior.

### 2. **Multilevel Inheritance**
   In multilevel inheritance, a derived class inherits from a base class, and another class inherits from that derived class.

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   
   class Animal {
   public:
       void speak() {
           std::cout << "Animal makes a sound" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   class Dog : public Animal {
   public:
       void bark() {
           std::cout << "Dog barks" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   class Puppy : public Dog {
   public:
       void play() {
           std::cout << "Puppy plays" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Puppy p;
       p.speak();  // Inherited from Animal
       p.bark();   // Inherited from Dog
       p.play();   // From Puppy class

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   Here:
   - `Puppy` is derived from `Dog`, and `Dog` is derived from `Animal`.
   - The `Puppy` class inherits from both `Dog` and `Animal`.

### 3. **Multiple Inheritance**
   C++ allows multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from more than one base class.

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   class Animal {
   public:
       void eat() {
           std::cout << "Animal is eating" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   class Bird {
   public:
       void fly() {
           std::cout << "Bird is flying" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   class Sparrow : public Animal, public Bird {
   public:
       void chirp() {
           std::cout << "Sparrow chirps" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Sparrow s;
       s.eat();   // Inherited from Animal
       s.fly();   // Inherited from Bird
       s.chirp(); // From Sparrow class

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   In this case, `Sparrow` inherits from both `Animal` and `Bird`, making it an example of multiple inheritance.

### 4. **Abstract Classes and Hierarchy**
   In C++, an **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is typically used to define a common interface for derived classes. It often contains **pure virtual functions** that must be implemented by derived classes.

   **Example of Abstract Class:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   
   // Abstract base class
   class Shape {
   public:
       virtual void draw() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
   };

   // Derived class
   class Circle : public Shape {
   public:
       void draw() override {
           std::cout << "Drawing Circle" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   // Another derived class
   class Rectangle : public Shape {
   public:
       void draw() override {
           std::cout << "Drawing Rectangle" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Shape* s1 = new Circle();
       s1->draw();  // Output: Drawing Circle

       Shape* s2 = new Rectangle();
       s2->draw();  // Output: Drawing Rectangle

       delete s1;
       delete s2;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   In this example:
   - `Shape` is an abstract class with a pure virtual function `draw`.
   - `Circle` and `Rectangle` are concrete classes that implement the `draw` method.

### 5. **Access Control in Hierarchy:**
   C++ allows different types of access specifiers that control the visibility of class members in a hierarchy:

   - **public**: Members are accessible from anywhere.
   - **protected**: Members are accessible within the class and its derived classes.
   - **private**: Members are accessible only within the class itself.

   Example:

   ```cpp
   class Base {
   private:
       int x;
   protected:
       int y;
   public:
       int z;
   };

   class Derived : public Base {
   public:
       void setValues() {
           // x is not accessible (private)
           // y is accessible (protected)
           z = 10;  // z is accessible (public)
       }
   };
   ```

### 6. **Polymorphism in Hierarchy:**
   - **Polymorphism** is the ability of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. The most common form of polymorphism is **runtime polymorphism** (dynamic dispatch), which allows methods to be overridden in derived classes.
   - A base class pointer or reference can point to objects of derived classes, and the appropriate method is called based on the type of the object.

   ```cpp
   class Base {
   public:
       virtual void display() {
           std::cout << "Base class display" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   class Derived : public Base {
   public:
       void display() override {
           std::cout << "Derived class display" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Base* bptr;
       Derived d;
       bptr = &d;

       // Calls Derived's display() due to polymorphism
       bptr->display();  // Output: Derived class display

       return 0;
   }
   ```

### Conclusion:
Hierarchy in C++ is closely tied to **object-oriented programming** concepts, especially **inheritance**. It enables the creation of class structures where more specialized classes inherit from more general ones. Key principles in C++ hierarchy include inheritance types (single, multiple, multilevel), abstraction, polymorphism, and the use of access control to manage visibility of class members. By leveraging these concepts, developers can create well-structured and reusable code.
