No, C programming does not have a built-in **reference** concept as seen in C++ or other modern languages like Java or Python.

However, C does support **pointers**, which can be used in a similar way to **references** in other languages.

### Key Differences Between References and Pointers in C++ and C:

1. **References in C++**:
   - A **reference** in C++ is an alias for another variable. Once a reference is initialized, it cannot be reassigned to refer to a different object.
   - Syntax example: 
     ```cpp
     int x = 10;
     int &ref = x;  // 'ref' is a reference to 'x'
     ```

2. **Pointers in C**:
   - C does not have references, but **pointers** are used to achieve similar behavior. A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. You can dereference the pointer to access the value stored at the address it points to.
   - Syntax example:
     ```c
     int x = 10;
     int *ptr = &x;  // 'ptr' is a pointer to 'x'
     ```

### How Pointers Can Mimic References in C:
While C does not have references, you can use pointers in functions to modify the value of variables, which is one of the common use cases for references in C++.

### Example: Passing by Reference (using pointers) in C:

In C, you can use pointers to simulate pass-by-reference behavior.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function that modifies the value of the argument
void modifyValue(int *x) {
    *x = 20;  // Dereference pointer to modify value at memory address
}

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    printf("Before: %d\n", num);  // Output: 10

    modifyValue(&num);  // Pass the address of 'num' to the function

    printf("After: %d\n", num);  // Output: 20

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- We pass the **address** of `num` to the `modifyValue` function using the `&` operator.
- Inside the function, we dereference the pointer `*x` to modify the value at the memory location that `x` points to.

### Comparison to C++ References:
In C++, you could achieve the same result more easily using references like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void modifyValue(int &x) {
    x = 20;  // Reference to 'x' is modified directly
}

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    cout << "Before: " << num << endl;  // Output: 10

    modifyValue(num);  // Pass by reference

    cout << "After: " << num << endl;  // Output: 20

    return 0;
}
```

### Conclusion:
- C does not have **references** in the strict sense, but **pointers** in C can be used to achieve similar functionality, especially for tasks like modifying values in functions or dynamic memory management.
- Pointers allow indirect access to variables, and while they do not have the same syntax or safety features as references, they provide the same ability to modify data outside the scope of the function (as in pass-by-reference).
