## ** Understanding Class Relationships in C++**

üßë‚Äçüè´ *"Imagine you're the architect of a smart city. You‚Äôre not just designing buildings ‚Äî you're designing how they interact: roads, power grids, and communication lines. That‚Äôs exactly what you do in C++ with **classes** ‚Äî you design how the different components of your program live, work, and interact with each other."*

In the world of **Object-Oriented Programming**, **classes** are your building blocks. But **relationships between them**? That‚Äôs your blueprint. Let's walk through it like a real-life story.



### üèóÔ∏è **Why Class Relationships Matter**

> Good design isn't just about writing code that works ‚Äî it's about writing code that **models real-world systems** and is **easy to maintain, reuse, and extend**.

Class relationships are the heart of this architecture.

Let‚Äôs break them down with simple analogies you‚Äôll never forget.


## üß¨ 1. **Is-a Relationship (Inheritance)**

üí¨ *‚ÄúA Manager is an Employee.‚Äù*

Imagine a company. There are general employees and then there are managers. Managers can do everything an employee does ‚Äî and maybe more (like approve leaves or assign tasks).

```cpp
class Employee {
public:
    void work() { cout << "Working..." << endl; }
};

class Manager : public Employee {
public:
    void approveLeave() { cout << "Leave approved!" << endl; }
};
```

üß† This is called **inheritance** ‚Äî where one class **inherits** the behavior of another. The child class **is-a** type of the parent class.

üìå *Tip:* Use when there‚Äôs a clear hierarchy or specialization.


## üß© 2. **Has-a Relationship (Composition/Aggregation)**

üí¨ *‚ÄúA Car has an Engine.‚Äù*

A car is not an engine. But it **has** one. The engine can‚Äôt live on its own ‚Äî it belongs to the car.

```cpp
class Engine {
public:
    void start() { cout << "Engine starting..." << endl; }
};

class Car {
private:
    Engine engine;  // Composition
public:
    void drive() {
        engine.start();
        cout << "Driving the car!" << endl;
    }
};
```

This is **composition** ‚Äî one class contains another as a part. The car **has-a** engine.

> üß± *Composition means strong ownership* ‚Äî if the car is destroyed, so is the engine.

For **aggregation**, the relationship is looser ‚Äî like a `Department` **has-a** list of `Employees`, but employees can exist outside the department too.


## üîÅ 3. **Uses-a Relationship (Dependency)**

üí¨ *‚ÄúA Printer uses a Document to print.‚Äù*

The printer doesn‚Äôt own the document. It just needs it temporarily to do a task.

```cpp
class Document {
public:
    void getContent() { cout << "Reading document content..." << endl; }
};

class Printer {
public:
    void print(Document doc) {
        doc.getContent();
        cout << "Printing document..." << endl;
    }
};
```

This is **dependency** ‚Äî a class uses another temporarily to perform some function.

üìå Use this when the association is **short-lived** and not structural.

 

## üß† Mentor Wisdom Time:

üë®‚Äçüè´ *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just learn syntax. Think like a **system designer**. Every class is like a team member. Some are leaders (inheritance), some are collaborators (composition), and some are service providers (dependency).‚Äù*

## üéØ Practice Challenge

üéí Design a small system:

* A `School` has `Teachers` and `Students`.
* A `Teacher` **is-a** `Person`.
* A `Teacher` uses a `Whiteboard` to teach.

‚û°Ô∏è Try implementing this with correct class relationships.

### Problem Statement ( Shape and Point)

#### Overview:
The goal of this problem is to design a system that can represent various geometric shapes using **containment** relationships rather than inheritance. Specifically, the **`Point`** class will serve as a foundational unit for all shapes, and all shapes (e.g., **Line**, **Rectangle**, **Circle**, **Triangle**) will contain one or more **Point** objects as part of their definition. Each shape will have properties and methods to calculate area, perimeter, and display relevant information about the shape.

#### Requirements:

1. **Containment Relationship**:
   - Instead of inheritance, shapes will **contain** one or more **Point** objects to define their geometry.
   - For instance:
     - A **Point** represents a specific coordinate in the 2D plane.
     - A **Line** contains two **Point** objects (start and end points).
     - A **Rectangle** contains two **Point** objects (top-left and bottom-right corners).
     - A **Circle** contains one **Point** object (center) and a radius.
     - A **Triangle** contains three **Point** objects (representing the vertices).

2. **Class Definitions**:

   - **Base Class: `Point`**:
     - Represents a point in the 2D plane with `x` and `y` coordinates.
     - Contains:
       - `x` (double): X-coordinate of the point.
       - `y` (double): Y-coordinate of the point.
     - A constructor to initialize the point's coordinates.
     - A method to display the point's coordinates (`displayPoint()`).

   - **Class: `Shape`**:
     - A generic base class that provides common methods for shapes, such as `calculateArea()` and `calculatePerimeter()`. These methods will be virtual, allowing derived classes to override them.
     - Includes a `display()` method to display information about the shape.
     - **Note**: This class will not directly represent a shape but will serve as a common interface for all derived shapes.

   - **Derived Class: `Line`** (contains two `Point` objects):
     - Represents a line segment defined by two points: a start point and an end point.
     - Contains two `Point` objects, `startPoint` and `endPoint`.
     - A constructor to initialize the line's start and end points.
     - A method to calculate the length of the line using the distance formula between the two points.
     - A method to display the line's start and end points.

   - **Derived Class: `Rectangle`** (contains two `Point` objects):
     - Represents a rectangle defined by two points: the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner.
     - Contains two `Point` objects, `topLeft` and `bottomRight`.
     - A constructor to initialize the rectangle's coordinates.
     - Methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
     - A method to display the rectangle's details, including the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners.

   - **Derived Class: `Circle`** (contains one `Point` object):
     - Represents a circle defined by its center (a point) and radius.
     - Contains a `Point` object for the center and a `double` value for the radius.
     - A constructor to initialize the circle's center and radius.
     - Methods to calculate the area and circumference of the circle.
     - A method to display the circle's center and radius.

   - **Derived Class: `Triangle`** (contains three `Point` objects):
     - Represents a triangle defined by three points, representing the vertices of the triangle.
     - Contains three `Point` objects for the triangle‚Äôs vertices.
     - A constructor to initialize the triangle's vertices.
     - Methods to calculate the area of the triangle using the determinant formula or Heron's formula.
     - A method to display the triangle's vertex coordinates.

3. **Key Operations**:
   - Each class should provide methods to:
     - **Calculate Area**: Calculate the area of the shape (specific formulas for each shape).
     - **Calculate Perimeter/Circumference**: Calculate the perimeter (for polygons) or circumference (for circles).
     - **Display Shape Information**: Display the relevant information about the shape (e.g., coordinates, area, perimeter).

4. **Method Inheritance**:
   - Each derived class should override the `calculateArea()` and `calculatePerimeter()` methods.
   - The `display()` method should provide a detailed description of each shape's properties, such as coordinates and area.

5. **Output**:
   - For each shape, the program should display the following details:
     - Shape type
     - Coordinates (for points, lines, and polygons)
     - Area (for appropriate shapes)
     - Perimeter or Circumference (for appropriate shapes)

#### Input:
- The program should create objects for the following shapes:
  - **Point**: A single point with coordinates.
  - **Line**: Two points representing the start and end of the line.
  - **Rectangle**: Two points representing the top-left and bottom-right corners.
  - **Circle**: A point for the center and a radius value.
  - **Triangle**: Three points representing the triangle's vertices.

#### Output:
The program should display the following details for each shape:

```
Shape Type: Point
Coordinates: (x, y)

Shape Type: Line
Start Point: (x1, y1)
End Point: (x2, y2)
Length of Line: <length>

Shape Type: Rectangle
Top-Left: (x1, y1)
Bottom-Right: (x2, y2)
Area: <area>
Perimeter: <perimeter>

Shape Type: Circle
Center: (x, y)
Radius: <radius>
Area: <area>
Circumference: <circumference>

Shape Type: Triangle
Vertices: (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)
Area: <area>
```

#### Example:

```
Shape Type: Point
Coordinates: (1.0, 2.0)

Shape Type: Line
Start Point: (1.0, 2.0)
End Point: (3.0, 4.0)
Length of Line: 2.82843

Shape Type: Rectangle
Top-Left: (0.0, 5.0)
Bottom-Right: (4.0, 1.0)
Area: 20
Perimeter: 14

Shape Type: Circle
Center: (0.0, 0.0)
Radius: 5.0
Area: 78.5398
Circumference: 31.4159

Shape Type: Triangle
Vertices: (0.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (2.0, 3.0)
Area: 6
```

#### Constraints:
- All coordinates (x, y) are floating-point values.
- The program should support dynamic memory allocation for shape objects.
- Ensure proper input validation (e.g., for non-negative radius and valid point coordinates).
- Use appropriate mathematical formulas to compute area and perimeter/circumference.
  
#### Objective:
Design and implement the **Point**, **Shape**, **Line**, **Rectangle**, **Circle**, and **Triangle** classes with a **containment** relationship in C++ using **composition** rather than inheritance. Each shape should contain instances of the **Point** class as part of its structure. Implement the necessary methods for calculating areas, perimeters, and displaying shape details.
