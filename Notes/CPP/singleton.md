# Singleton Design Pattern


In C++, a **singleton class** is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. The singleton pattern is useful when you need to manage a shared resource (such as a configuration object, logging service, or database connection) and you want to ensure that only one instance of the class is created.

### Key Characteristics of Singleton Class:
1. **Only one instance**: The class ensures that only one instance of the class is created throughout the entire program.
2. **Global access point**: The class provides a global access point to get that instance.
3. **Lazy instantiation**: The instance is created only when it is first needed, not before.

### Steps to Create a Singleton Class in C++:
1. Make the constructor **private** to prevent direct object creation.
2. Make the **copy constructor** and **assignment operator** private to prevent copying of the instance.
3. Provide a **static method** (often `getInstance()`) to return the single instance.
4. Ensure the instance is created only when needed (lazy instantiation).

### Example of a Singleton Class in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Singleton {
private:
    static Singleton* instance;  // Static pointer to the single instance
    int value;  // Example data member
    
    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation outside of the class
    Singleton() {
        value = 0;
        cout << "Singleton created!" << endl;
    }

    // Private copy constructor to prevent copying
    Singleton(const Singleton& other) = delete;
    
    // Private assignment operator to prevent assignment
    Singleton& operator=(const Singleton& other) = delete;

public:
    // Static method to get the instance of the Singleton class
    static Singleton* getInstance() {
        if (instance == nullptr) {
            // Lazy instantiation: Create the instance only when needed
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Example method to demonstrate functionality
    void setValue(int val) {
        value = val;
    }

    void showValue() {
        cout << "Value: " << value << endl;
    }

    // Destructor to clean up the instance when the program ends
    ~Singleton() {
        cout << "Singleton destroyed!" << endl;
    }
};

// Initialize the static instance pointer to nullptr
Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr;

int main() {
    // Get the single instance of the Singleton class
    Singleton* singleton1 = Singleton::getInstance();
    singleton1->setValue(10);
    singleton1->showValue();

    // Try to create another instance, but it will return the same instance
    Singleton* singleton2 = Singleton::getInstance();
    singleton2->showValue();  // It will show the same value

    // Output will demonstrate that both pointers point to the same instance
    cout << "Are both instances the same? " << (singleton1 == singleton2 ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Private Constructor**:
   - The constructor is **private** so that no objects can be created from outside the class. The instance can only be created within the class using the `getInstance()` method.

2. **Static Instance Pointer**:
   - `static Singleton* instance;` is a static pointer that holds the single instance of the class. It is initialized to `nullptr` initially, and only when the `getInstance()` method is called for the first time will the instance be created.

3. **Static `getInstance()` Method**:
   - The static method `getInstance()` checks whether the instance has already been created. If not, it creates the instance. If it has already been created, it returns the existing instance.
   
4. **Private Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator**:
   - The copy constructor and assignment operator are **deleted** (`= delete`) to prevent copying of the Singleton instance.

5. **Destructor**:
   - The destructor is used to clean up the instance. However, in this simple example, the instance is not deleted at the end. In a real-world case, you might use smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr` to handle automatic cleanup, or implement a cleanup method to delete the instance when the program ends.

### Output of the Code:
```
Singleton created!
Value: 10
Value: 10
Are both instances the same? Yes
Singleton destroyed!
```

### Key Points to Remember:
- **Private Constructor**: Prevents direct instantiation of the class.
- **Static Instance**: Ensures only one instance of the class is created.
- **Singleton Access**: The `getInstance()` method provides the global access point to the singleton instance.
- **No Copying**: The copy constructor and assignment operator are deleted to prevent copying.
- **Lazy Initialization**: The singleton instance is created only when it is first needed.

### Thread-Safety Considerations:
In a multi-threaded environment, the above implementation may have issues with race conditions. To make the singleton thread-safe, you can use **mutexes** or rely on **C++11 thread-safe initialization** (which ensures that the static instance is initialized only once even in a multi-threaded environment).

Hereâ€™s a simple thread-safe version using **C++11's `std::mutex`**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
using namespace std;

class Singleton {
private:
    static Singleton* instance;
    static std::mutex mtx;  // Mutex for thread safety
    int value;
    
    Singleton() {
        value = 0;
        cout << "Singleton created!" << endl;
    }

    Singleton(const Singleton& other) = delete;
    Singleton& operator=(const Singleton& other) = delete;

public:
    static Singleton* getInstance() {
        if (instance == nullptr) {
            std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx); // Lock the mutex to ensure thread safety
            if (instance == nullptr) {
                instance = new Singleton();
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }

    void setValue(int val) {
        value = val;
    }

    void showValue() {
        cout << "Value: " << value << endl;
    }

    ~Singleton() {
        cout << "Singleton destroyed!" << endl;
    }
};

Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr;
std::mutex Singleton::mtx;  // Initialize mutex

int main() {
    Singleton* singleton1 = Singleton::getInstance();
    singleton1->setValue(10);
    singleton1->showValue();

    Singleton* singleton2 = Singleton::getInstance();
    singleton2->showValue();

    cout << "Are both instances the same? " << (singleton1 == singleton2 ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This thread-safe implementation ensures that even in a multithreaded environment, only one instance of the Singleton is created.
