### Project Documentation: Architecture, Flow, and Best Practices


#### **1. Project Architecture**

The project follows a layered architecture, which ensures separation of concerns and modularity. Below is an overview of the architecture:

1. **Entity Layer**:
   - Contains core data models such as `Product` and `Customer`.
   - These classes encapsulate the attributes and behaviors of the application's domain objects.

2. **Repository Layer**:
   - Example: `ProductRepository`
   - Acts as an in-memory storage for entities.
   - Provides methods to add, retrieve, and manage entities.

3. **Service Layer**:
   - Example: `ProductService`
   - Contains business logic, such as applying discounts, calculating total prices, and searching for products.
   - Acts as an intermediary between the repository and controller layers.

4. **Controller Layer**:
   - Example: `ProductsController`, `CustomersController`
   - Handles user requests and delegates them to the appropriate service methods.
   - Acts as a mediator between the UI and service layers.

5. **UI Layer**:
   - Example: `UIManager`
   - Manages user interaction, such as displaying menus and handling input.
   - Delegates user actions to the controller layer.

6. **Helper Layer**:
   - Example: `ProductIOManager`
   - Provides utility functions, such as reading and writing data to files.

---

#### **2. Application Flow**

The flow of the application is as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The application starts in `Main.cpp`.
   - `ProductIOManager` loads product data from a file (`products.txt`) into a vector of `Product` objects.

2. **Repository Setup**:
   - The loaded products are added to the `ProductRepository`, which acts as the in-memory storage.

3. **Service and Controller Setup**:
   - The `ProductService` is initialized with the repository to provide business logic.
   - The `ProductsController` is initialized with the repository and service to handle user requests.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - The `UIManager` displays a menu and handles user input.
   - User actions are passed to the `ProductsController`, which invokes the appropriate service methods.

5. **Business Logic Execution**:
   - The `ProductService` performs operations such as applying discounts, searching for products, and calculating totals.

6. **Output**:
   - Results are displayed to the user via the `UIManager`.

#### **3. Best Practices Followed**

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Each layer has a distinct responsibility, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

2. **Single Responsibility Principle**:
   - Each class is responsible for a single aspect of the application, e.g., `ProductRepository` handles data storage, and `ProductService` handles business logic.

3. **Encapsulation**:
   - Data members in entity classes like `Product` and `Customer` are private, with public getter and setter methods.

4. **Reusability**:
   - Utility classes like `ProductIOManager` are reusable across different parts of the application.

5. **Scalability**:
   - The layered architecture allows for easy addition of new features, such as additional services or UI components.

6. **Code Readability**:
   - The code is well-structured, with meaningful class and method names.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - File operations and other critical sections include error handling to ensure robustness.

#### **4. Example Class Roles**

- **`Product`**:
  - Represents a product with attributes like ID, title, description, category, quantity, and price.

- **`Customer`**:
  - Represents a customer with attributes like ID, name, email, phone number, and address.

- **`ProductRepository`**:
  - Stores and manages `Product` objects in memory.

- **`ProductService`**:
  - Provides business logic for managing products, such as applying discounts and searching.

- **`ProductsController`**:
  - Handles user requests related to products and delegates them to the service layer.

- **`UIManager`**:
  - Manages user interaction, such as displaying menus and handling input.

- **`ProductIOManager`**:
  - Handles file I/O operations for loading and saving product data.

The layered architecture used in your application provides several advantages, particularly for maintainability, scalability, and clarity. Here's how it benefits your application:

---

### **Advantages of Layered Architecture**

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Each layer has a distinct responsibility:
     - **Entity Layer**: Defines the data models (e.g., `Customer`, `Product`).
     - **Repository Layer**: Manages data storage and retrieval.
     - **Service Layer**: Contains business logic.
     - **Controller Layer**: Handles user requests and delegates tasks.
     - **UI Layer**: Manages user interaction.
   - This separation makes the code easier to understand, debug, and maintain.

2. **Modularity**:
   - Each layer is independent, allowing you to modify or replace one layer without affecting others.
   - For example, you can change the file handling logic in `ProductIOManager` without impacting the `ProductsController` or `UIManager`.

3. **Reusability**:
   - Components like `ProductService` or `ProductRepository` can be reused across different parts of the application or even in other projects.

4. **Scalability**:
   - The architecture supports adding new features or layers without disrupting the existing codebase.
   - For instance, you can add a new service for handling customer loyalty programs without affecting the product-related logic.

5. **Testability**:
   - Each layer can be tested independently:
     - Unit tests for the `ProductService` to validate business logic.
     - Integration tests for the `ProductsController` to ensure it interacts correctly with the service and repository layers.

6. **Maintainability**:
   - The clear separation of responsibilities makes it easier to locate and fix bugs or update functionality.
   - For example, if there's an issue with data persistence, you can focus on the repository layer.

7. **Scalability for Teams**:
   - Different teams or developers can work on different layers simultaneously without conflicts.
   - For example, one team can work on the UI while another focuses on the service layer.

8. **Flexibility**:
   - The architecture allows for easy integration of new technologies or frameworks.
   - For instance, you can replace the file-based storage in `ProductIOManager` with a database without affecting other layers.

9. **Consistency**:
   - Following a structured architecture ensures consistency across the codebase, making it easier for new developers to onboard and contribute.

10. **Encapsulation**:
    - Each layer hides its implementation details from others, exposing only what is necessary. This reduces the risk of unintended side effects.

---

### **Example in Your Application**

- **File Handling (`ProductIOManager`)**:
  - Handles reading and writing product data to files. If you decide to switch to a database, only this layer needs modification.

- **Business Logic (`ProductService`)**:
  - Applies discounts, calculates totals, and performs searches. This logic is centralized, ensuring consistency across the application.

- **Controller (`ProductsController`)**:
  - Acts as a bridge between the UI and the service layer. This ensures that the UI remains simple and focused on user interaction.

By adhering to this architecture, your application becomes more robust, easier to maintain, and adaptable to future requirements.
