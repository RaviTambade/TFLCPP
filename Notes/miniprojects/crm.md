### **Problem Statement for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System in C**

A **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System** is a software application that helps businesses manage their interactions with current and potential customers. The system aims to improve customer satisfaction, increase customer retention, and enhance overall business performance by organizing, automating, and tracking various aspects of customer relationships. This system will be designed using the C programming language and will focus on storing, retrieving, and managing customer data, including personal information, contact details, and interaction history.

The **CRM System** in C will allow businesses to efficiently manage customer interactions, store important customer information, track inquiries, and generate reports for decision-making. This system is particularly useful for small to medium-sized businesses that need an efficient way to organize customer details and enhance their relationship with clients.

### **Objective:**

The objective of the **CRM System in C** is to develop a simple but effective tool for managing customer relationships. The system will allow users (business representatives or administrators) to:
1. Add new customer details.
2. View and search customer information.
3. Update customer details.
4. Delete customer records.
5. Record interactions with customers, such as inquiries or feedback.
6. Generate reports for customer analysis.

---

### **System Features and Functional Requirements:**

1. **Customer Information Management:**
   - **Add Customer**: The system should allow users to add new customers by providing details such as customer ID, name, address, phone number, and email.
   - **View Customer**: Users should be able to view the list of all customers or search for customers by their ID, name, or other attributes.
   - **Update Customer Information**: The system should allow users to modify customer details like name, address, and contact information.
   - **Delete Customer**: The system should allow users to remove customer records from the database.

2. **Customer Interaction Management:**
   - **Record Interaction**: The system should allow users to record interactions with customers, such as calls, emails, or meetings. This includes tracking the interaction type, date, and details of the conversation.
   - **View Interactions**: The system should allow users to view the interaction history for a particular customer, helping the business track customer needs and preferences.

3. **Search and Reporting:**
   - **Search Customers**: Users should be able to search for customers by their name, customer ID, or contact details.
   - **Generate Reports**: The system should allow generating reports that list customers, their contact information, and interaction history.

4. **Data Validation:**
   - The system should ensure basic data validation such as checking for valid email addresses, phone numbers, and ensuring that required fields are not left empty.

5. **User Interface:**
   - The system should use a **text-based interface** for data entry and interaction. It will provide a simple menu that allows users to select actions like adding customers, viewing details, and recording interactions.

### **Data Structures:**

1. **Customer Structure:**
   Each customer will be represented by a structure containing the following attributes:
   - Customer ID
   - Name
   - Address
   - Phone number
   - Email address
   - Interaction history (could be another structure or linked list to store multiple interactions)

   ```c
   #define MAX_CUSTOMERS 100

   // Structure to store customer information
   struct Customer {
       int customerID;         // Unique identifier for each customer
       char name[100];         // Customer's full name
       char address[200];      // Customer's address
       char phone[15];         // Customer's phone number
       char email[100];        // Customer's email address
       char interactionHistory[500]; // Description of interactions with the customer
   };

   struct Customer customers[MAX_CUSTOMERS];
   int totalCustomers = 0;  // Total number of customers
   ```

2. **Interaction Structure:**
   Each interaction with a customer will be recorded, including the type of interaction (phone call, email, etc.) and the details of the interaction.

   ```c
   struct Interaction {
       char interactionType[50];  // Type of interaction (Phone, Email, etc.)
       char interactionDetails[500]; // Description of the interaction
       char date[20];             // Date of interaction
   };
   ```

---

### **Functional Requirements:**

1. **Add Customer:**
   - The system should allow the user to enter customer details, including name, address, phone number, and email. Each customer will be assigned a unique customer ID.

2. **View Customer Information:**
   - The system should allow the user to view a list of all customers or search for customers by name or customer ID.

3. **Update Customer Information:**
   - The system should allow updating a customer’s details such as name, address, phone, or email address.

4. **Delete Customer:**
   - The system should allow deleting a customer’s record from the database by their unique customer ID.

5. **Record Customer Interactions:**
   - For each customer, the system should allow recording multiple interactions, such as phone calls, emails, or meetings. Each interaction will include details about the interaction, the type (phone call, email, meeting, etc.), and the date.

6. **Generate Reports:**
   - The system should allow generating reports of all customers, displaying their details and interaction histories. The report could be filtered by customer type (e.g., all customers who interacted in the last week).

7. **Search Customers:**
   - The system should allow searching for customers based on customer ID, name, or phone number.

---

### **Sample Menu:**

```
Customer Relationship Management System
=======================================
1. Add New Customer
2. View All Customers
3. Search Customer by ID or Name
4. Update Customer Information
5. Delete Customer
6. Record Customer Interaction
7. View Customer Interaction History
8. Generate Customer Report
9. Exit
Enter your choice (1-9):
```

---

### **Constraints and Assumptions:**

1. **Fixed Capacity:**
   - The system will be limited to a maximum of `MAX_CUSTOMERS` (e.g., 100). If the number of customers exceeds this limit, no new customers can be added.

2. **Basic Input Validation:**
   - The system will perform basic validation to ensure that customer information (such as phone numbers and email addresses) is entered correctly.

3. **No Persistent Data Storage:**
   - The system will not save data to external files or a database. All data will be stored in memory during the session, and the data will be lost when the program ends. This feature can be extended in the future to allow file-based storage or integration with databases.

4. **Simple User Interface:**
   - The system will use a **text-based user interface** to interact with the user. The interface will provide options to the user for performing operations such as adding, updating, and deleting customer records.
