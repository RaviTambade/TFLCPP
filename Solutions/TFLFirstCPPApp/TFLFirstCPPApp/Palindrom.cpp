Title: A palindrome is a string of character that is the same forward and backward.
Typically, punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored.
For example, || Poor Dan is in a droop || is a palindrome, as can be seen by examining the characters 
             || poor danisina droop || and observing that they are the same forward and backward.
             One way to check for a palindrome is to reverse the characters in the string and
             then compare with them the original - in a palindrome, the sequence will be identical.
Write C++ program with functions - 
    1).to check whether given string is palindrome or not that uses a stack to determine whether a string is a palindrome. 
    2).to remove spaces and punctuation in string, convert all the Characters to lowercase, and then call above Palindrome checking function to check for a palindrome
    3).to print string in reverse order
