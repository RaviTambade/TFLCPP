# Model-View Architecture


**Model-View Architecture** is a design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: **Model**, **View**, and often **Controller** or **Presenter/ViewModel**, depending on the variant (MVC, MVP, MVVM). But in its most basic form, *Model-View* involves:

---

### 🧠 Model
- **What it is**: The data layer.
- **Responsibility**: Manages the business logic and the data of the application.
- **Examples**: Database records, structures, network responses, etc.
- **Does not** know anything about the UI.

---

### 👁️ View
- **What it is**: The UI layer.
- **Responsibility**: Presents data to the user.
- **Examples**: Screens, windows, web pages, buttons, etc.
- **Does not** modify the data directly—it reflects what the model provides.

---

### 🔁 How They Interact
- The **View observes the Model**: When the Model changes, the View gets updated (e.g., via observers, signals/slots, or data binding).
- The **View can notify changes** (like user actions) back to the Model (or through a controller/handler depending on architecture).

---

### ✅ Why Use Model-View
- Separation of concerns.
- Reusability of components.
- Easier testing (e.g., test logic separately from UI).
- Clean architecture and better maintainability.

---

### 🧩 Variants
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** – Controller handles user input and updates Model/View.
- **MVP (Model-View-Presenter)** – Presenter handles logic and communicates with both Model and View.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** – Common in frontend frameworks (e.g., SwiftUI, React), where ViewModel handles UI logic and two-way binding.

If you're building something like a `DataModelProvider` and views like `TopView`, `FrontView`, and `SideView`, you're already thinking in a Model-View architecture!
