# Asynchronous programming in C++

Asynchronous programming in C++ is a technique that allows tasks to be executed concurrently without blocking the main thread. It helps improve performance by running operations like I/O-bound tasks or long-running computations in parallel, rather than waiting for them to finish before continuing with other tasks.

It seems like you’re sharing a transcription of a conversation related to concurrency and multithreading in C++. From what I can gather, the conversation covers key aspects of object-oriented programming and its minor pillars, especially focusing on concurrency, multithreading, and task delegation.

To summarize some important points from the conversation:

1. **Concurrency**:
   - Concurrency refers to the ability of different objects or threads to act at the same time, enabling multiple tasks to be executed in parallel. This is especially useful in software development where an application has to handle multiple events or processes simultaneously, like in e-commerce applications (e.g., handling orders, payments, and product browsing concurrently).
   - Concurrency allows better performance and responsiveness, especially when multiple users interact with the application.

2. **Threads in C++**:
   - In C++, the concept of concurrency can be implemented using threads. The `std::thread` class is used to create and manage threads.
   - A thread is essentially a path of execution in a program. Multiple threads can execute different tasks concurrently.
   - Threads are created using the `std::thread` class, and tasks are passed to the thread via function pointers or lambdas.

3. **Thread Joining**:
   - When creating threads, it is essential to call `join()` on each thread to ensure that the main thread waits for the secondary threads to finish before exiting. This is similar to how a host manages multiple guests in a house — the host waits until all the guests are taken care of by family members (threads) before leaving.

4. **Practical Example**:
   - The conversation describes an example in which two functions (`print_hello` and `print_by`) are executed by separate threads in the main function. These functions are delegated to secondary threads using `std::thread`, and the main thread waits for these threads to finish by calling `join()` on each of them.

5. **Multithreading Advantage**:
   - Multithreading improves performance by delegating different tasks to different threads, thus allowing them to run concurrently. This reduces the overall time taken for the completion of tasks, as opposed to running everything sequentially on a single thread.

6. **Real-Life Analogy**:
   - The instructor uses an analogy of serving guests in a house. If one person (main thread) tries to serve all 50 guests, it would take a long time. But if 50 family members (threads) each serve one guest, all guests can be served simultaneously in a much shorter time.

### Some Key Points on the Code from the Discussion:

1. **Thread Header**:
   - The `#include <thread>` header is used to bring in the necessary functionality for working with threads.
   
2. **Creating Threads**:
   - The `std::thread` class is used to create threads. Each thread is passed a function (or task) to execute. 
   
   Example:
   ```cpp
   std::thread t(print_hello); // Creates a thread to execute print_hello
   ```

3. **Using `join()`**:
   - `join()` is used to ensure that the main thread waits for the created threads to finish before terminating.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   t.join(); // Waits for the thread t to finish execution before moving forward
   ```

4. **Multiple Threads Example**:
   - The example showed two threads running `print_hello` and `print_by` concurrently. Both tasks run in parallel on different threads.

### Full Example Code (Based on Discussion):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void print_hello() {
    std::cout << "Hello from thread!" << std::endl;
}

void print_by() {
    std::cout << "Thank you for using our services!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Primary thread execution started." << std::endl;

    // Create threads
    std::thread t1(print_hello);  // First thread for print_hello
    std::thread t2(print_by);     // Second thread for print_by

    // Join threads with the main thread
    t1.join();  // Waits for t1 to finish
    t2.join();  // Waits for t2 to finish

    std::cout << "Primary thread execution is about to terminate." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Takeaways:
- Concurrency is about allowing different tasks (like multiple users interacting with an application) to happen simultaneously.
- Threads allow multiple execution paths, where each thread can perform a different task, making the system more efficient.
- Multithreading can be leveraged in scenarios where parallel execution is beneficial, like in real-time applications or systems with multiple processes to manage.

It seems like you're discussing concepts of multithreading in programming, focusing on C++ and the use of threads for concurrent execution. Here's a breakdown of the key points from the explanation:

1. **Process vs Thread:**
   - A **process** is a program in execution, i.e., a program that's currently running in memory.
   - Each process can have multiple **threads**. A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process, and each thread can perform tasks concurrently with other threads.

2. **Multithreading:**
   - When multiple threads are used to perform tasks concurrently within the same process, it is called **multithreading**.
   - This allows for tasks to be executed in parallel, making the program more efficient, especially on multi-core processors.

3. **Primary Thread and Secondary Threads:**
   - A process has a **primary thread**, which is typically responsible for executing the main function.
   - **Secondary threads** can be created to perform other tasks concurrently.

4. **Thread Methods:**
   - You can control thread execution using methods like `sleep()`, which pauses a thread for a specified amount of time (in seconds).
   - The **sleep method** is useful for delaying the execution of threads, simulating tasks that take time or adjusting the speed of execution.
   - The `join()` method is used to make sure the main function doesn't terminate before all threads finish their execution.

5. **Infinite Loop and Thread Execution:**
   - In the example given, the print statements in each thread are running in an infinite loop, but with a delay (using `sleep()`), the threads alternate their execution.
   - The CPU assigns execution time to these threads, and depending on the delay, one thread might execute faster than the other.

6. **Concurrency and Performance:**
   - **Concurrency** is achieved when multiple threads are running independently, executing tasks in parallel.
   - Threads can be used to maximize CPU usage, allowing tasks to run faster on multi-core processors.

7. **Practical Applications:**
   - This concept is applied in situations like simulations, animations, or when you need to execute tasks that are independent of each other (e.g., downloading files in the background while performing other tasks).

8. **Final Thoughts:**
   - In real applications, you might use multithreading for things like 3D graphics rendering, where the speed of execution can be adjusted by controlling the thread's execution speed.

In C++, asynchronous programming is typically done using threads, `std::async`, or other concurrency mechanisms such as `std::thread`. The most modern and efficient way to handle asynchronous tasks in C++ is by using the `std::async` function from the C++11 standard, which simplifies managing threads and can be used to run tasks asynchronously.

Here’s an overview of how to use asynchronous programming in C++ with examples.

### 1. **Using `std::async` (C++11 and later)**

The `std::async` function runs a task asynchronously in a separate thread and returns a `std::future` object. The `std::future` allows you to obtain the result of the task once it is completed.

#### Example: Using `std::async` with `std::future`
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <future>
#include <chrono>

// A function to simulate a time-consuming task
int long_task() {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2)); // Simulate a 2-second task
    return 42;
}

int main() {
    // Launch the task asynchronously
    std::future<int> result = std::async(std::launch::async, long_task);

    // Perform other work while the long task is running
    std::cout << "Doing other work..." << std::endl;

    // Get the result from the asynchronous task (this will block if the task hasn't completed yet)
    int result_value = result.get(); // Get the result of long_task

    std::cout << "Task completed. The result is: " << result_value << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`std::async`**: This function is used to launch a task asynchronously. It runs the given function in a new thread.
- **`std::future<int>`**: The `std::future` object is used to retrieve the result of the asynchronous task once it completes.
- **`result.get()`**: This call will block the main thread until the result of the asynchronous task is available.

### 2. **Using `std::thread` (C++11 and later)**

Another approach to asynchronous programming in C++ is by using `std::thread`. This is more manual than `std::async`, as you have to manage the thread explicitly.

#### Example: Using `std::thread` for asynchronous execution
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>

// A function to simulate a time-consuming task
void long_task() {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2)); // Simulate a 2-second task
    std::cout << "Task completed!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // Launch the task in a separate thread
    std::thread t(long_task);

    // Perform other work while the task is running
    std::cout << "Doing other work..." << std::endl;

    // Wait for the thread to finish
    t.join(); // Blocks until the thread 't' finishes

    std::cout << "Main thread finished." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`std::thread`**: This is used to create a new thread that runs the function passed to it (in this case, `long_task`).
- **`t.join()`**: This call blocks the main thread until the thread `t` has finished executing. If you don’t call `join()` or `detach()`, your program might terminate before the thread finishes, leading to undefined behavior.

### 3. **Using `std::promise` and `std::future` (C++11 and later)**

A more advanced way to manage asynchronous tasks is using `std::promise` in combination with `std::future`. A `std::promise` is used to set a value (or exception) that can be accessed via a `std::future`.

#### Example: Using `std::promise` and `std::future`
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <future>
#include <chrono>

void long_task(std::promise<int> promise_obj) {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2)); // Simulate a 2-second task
    promise_obj.set_value(42); // Set the result of the task
}

int main() {
    // Create a promise object and get a future
    std::promise<int> promise;
    std::future<int> result = promise.get_future();

    // Launch the task in a separate thread
    std::thread t(long_task, std::move(promise));

    // Perform other work while the task is running
    std::cout << "Doing other work..." << std::endl;

    // Get the result from the asynchronous task
    int result_value = result.get(); // This blocks until the result is set

    std::cout << "Task completed. The result is: " << result_value << std::endl;

    t.join(); // Ensure the thread has finished

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`std::promise`**: This object is used to set a value that can be retrieved later.
- **`std::future`**: Used to retrieve the value set by the `std::promise`.
- **`promise.set_value()`**: Sets the result of the asynchronous operation.
- **`future.get()`**: Retrieves the result of the promise, blocking the main thread until the value is available.

### Conclusion:
C++ provides several ways to perform asynchronous programming, with `std::async`, `std::thread`, and `std::promise` being the most common approaches. The best option depends on the complexity and control you need over the threads and tasks. For simple use cases, `std::async` is typically the easiest, while `std::thread` and `std::promise` offer more control and flexibility.
