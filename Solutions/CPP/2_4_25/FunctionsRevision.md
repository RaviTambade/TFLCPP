# Revisions of Functions in C++


### **Global Functions:**

A **global function** is a function that is defined outside of any class or object. This function can be accessed from anywhere within the program, provided that it is declared or visible to the part of the code that wants to use it.

- **Example**: 
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   void display() {
       cout << "Hello, this is a global function!" << endl;
   }

   int main() {
       display(); // Calling the global function inside main
       return 0;
   }
   ```
In this example, `display()` is a global function because it's not defined inside any class. It can be called from the `main()` function or any other function within the program.

### **Global Variables:**

A **global variable** is a variable that is declared outside of any function, class, or object. It can be accessed and modified by any function in the program.

- **Example**:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   string printerTitle = "Inkjet Printer"; // Global variable

   void printTitle() {
       cout << "Printer Title: " << printerTitle << endl;
   }

   int main() {
       printTitle(); // Accessing global variable inside a function
       printerTitle = "Laserjet Printer"; // Modifying global variable
       printTitle(); // Accessing modified global variable
       return 0;
   }
   ```
Here, the `printerTitle` is a global variable. It is accessed and modified by multiple functions, such as `printTitle()` and `main()`.

### **Local Functions (Not Directly Supported in C++):**

In C++, **local functions** (functions defined within other functions) are not allowed. However, you can simulate the behavior of local functions using **lambda functions** in C++11 and later.

- **Example of a Lambda Function**:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
       // Lambda function defined inside main
       auto display = []() {
           cout << "This is a local function using a lambda!" << endl;
       };
       display(); // Calling the lambda function
       return 0;
   }
   ```
In this case, the lambda function `display()` is defined inside the `main()` function, and it behaves like a local function.

### **Member Functions:**

A **member function** is a function that is defined inside a class. It operates on the data members of the class and can manipulate them.

- **Example**:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   class BankAccount {
   private:
       double balance; // Data member

   public:
       BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
           balance = initialBalance; // Constructor to initialize balance
       }

       void deposit(double amount) {
           balance += amount; // Member function to modify data member
       }

       void withdraw(double amount) {
           if (amount <= balance) {
               balance -= amount; // Member function to modify data member
           } else {
               cout << "Insufficient balance!" << endl;
           }
       }

       void showBalance() {
           cout << "Current Balance: " << balance << endl;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       BankAccount myAccount(500.0);
       myAccount.deposit(200.0); // Calling member function
       myAccount.withdraw(150.0); // Calling member function
       myAccount.showBalance(); // Calling member function
       return 0;
   }
   ```
In this example, `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `showBalance()` are member functions that manipulate the `balance` data member of the `BankAccount` class.

### **Summary:**

1. **Global Functions**: Defined outside any class or object, accessible from anywhere in the program.
2. **Local Functions**: In C++, there is no direct support for defining functions inside other functions. However, **lambda functions** can mimic this functionality.
3. **Member Functions**: Defined inside a class, operate on data members of the class, and are specific to the class instances.

Youâ€™ve also touched on the difference between **local variables** and **global variables** in terms of scope and lifetime:
- **Global Variables**: Accessible from anywhere in the program.
- **Local Variables**: Accessible only within the function or block where they are declared.

It looks like you've provided a detailed explanation on **member functions**, **static functions**, **constructors**, and some concepts related to **global functions** and **variables** in C++. I'll break down your explanation and clarify these concepts:

### **Member Functions in C++:**

A **member function** is a function that is defined inside a class. It operates on the data members of that class and defines the behavior or actions that an object of the class can perform. You can think of member functions as the "behaviors" of a class, while the data members represent the "state."

For example, in the **bank account** scenario, you have the following member functions:

1. **Deposit**: Adds money to the balance.
2. **Withdraw**: Subtracts money from the balance.
3. **Apply interest**: Applies an interest rate to the balance.
4. **Apply fine**: Deducts a penalty from the balance.

### **Example of Member Functions:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Account {
private:
    double balance; // Data member

public:
    Account(double initialBalance) { // Constructor to initialize balance
        balance = initialBalance;
    }

    void deposit(double amount) { // Deposit function (member function)
        balance += amount;
    }

    void withdraw(double amount) { // Withdraw function (member function)
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            cout << "Insufficient funds!" << endl;
        }
    }

    void applyInterest(double rate) { // Apply interest function (member function)
        balance += balance * rate;
    }

    void showBalance() { // Display balance (member function)
        cout << "Balance: " << balance << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Account myAccount(1000); // Create an Account object with initial balance of 1000
    myAccount.deposit(500);   // Deposit 500
    myAccount.withdraw(200);  // Withdraw 200
    myAccount.applyInterest(0.05); // Apply 5% interest
    myAccount.showBalance(); // Display balance after operations
    return 0;
}
```
### **Explanation of the Code:**
- **Deposit and Withdraw Functions**: These modify the `balance` data member of the `Account` class.
- **Apply Interest Function**: This modifies the `balance` based on the interest rate.
- **Constructor**: The constructor is used to initialize the `balance` when an object is created.

### **Static Functions in C++:**

A **static function** is a function that is defined inside a class but is not associated with any particular object of that class. It is shared among all instances of the class, meaning that it can be called without creating an object of the class.

- **Static functions** can only access **static variables**.
- They cannot access instance-specific variables (i.e., the `this` pointer).
- You call static functions using the class name, not an object.

### **Example of a Static Function:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Counter {
private:
    static int count; // Static variable to keep track of the count

public:
    Counter() {
        count++; // Increment count when an object is created
    }

    static int getCount() { // Static member function
        return count; // Can only access static variable count
    }
};

int Counter::count = 0; // Initialize the static variable

int main() {
    Counter c1, c2, c3;
    cout << "Number of Counter objects created: " << Counter::getCount() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
### **Explanation of Static Function:**
- `count` is a static variable, meaning it is shared by all objects of the `Counter` class.
- `getCount` is a static function and can only access the `count` variable. It cannot access non-static members like individual objects' data members.
- You call `getCount()` using the class name (`Counter::getCount()`), not an object.

### **Constructors in C++:**

A **constructor** is a special member function of a class that is called when an object of the class is created. It is used to initialize the object's data members.

- In the `Account` class example above, the constructor takes an `initialBalance` and initializes the `balance` data member.

### **Static Variables in C++:**

A **static variable** in a class is shared by all objects of the class. It is not tied to a particular object, unlike regular instance variables. A static variable can be accessed and modified by static functions.

- **Example**: The `count` variable in the `Counter` class is a static variable that tracks how many objects of the class have been created.

### **Global Functions:**

A **global function** is a function that is defined outside of any class. It is not associated with an object, and it can be called from anywhere in the program, provided it is declared.

- **Example**: The `display` function in your earlier code is a global function because it is not inside a class.

### **Summary of Concepts:**
1. **Member Functions**: Defined inside a class, operate on the data members of the class, and describe the behaviors of the objects.
2. **Static Functions**: Defined inside a class but not tied to any specific object. Can only access static variables and are invoked using the class name.
3. **Constructors**: Special member functions used to initialize objects.
4. **Static Variables**: Shared among all objects of a class; can be accessed by static functions.
5. **Global Functions**: Defined outside of a class, can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

### **Software Design:**
In software design, you often define classes with data members (representing the state) and member functions (representing the behavior). The logic and business rules are implemented in the member functions, and the data is encapsulated within the class.

This is the foundation of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, where you bundle data and the methods that operate on that data together into a single unit (a class), and then create objects (instances) of that class to interact with and manipulate the data.
